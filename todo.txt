To Do:
1. Add more tools: Code executor, calculator, PDF reader
2. Add more agents: Planner agent, critic agent
3. Add memory: Store past research for context
4. Add streaming: Real-time updates as agents work
5. Build a web UI: Flask/FastAPI frontend
6. Deploy it: Docker, AWS Lambda, etc.

Example agent ideas:
Auto-triage engineering tickets
Auto-investigate cloud alerts
Auto-generate PR reviews + fix suggestions
Auto-summarize logs from distributed systems

Level-up:
Implement ReAct, Tree-of-Thought, and custom search policy.

Strategic Agents:

Planner - Breaks complex queries into subtasks before research starts
Critic - Reviews final output for gaps, errors, contradictions
Query Refinement - Improves vague queries before research

Tool-Focused Agents:

Code Executor - Runs Python/JS for calculations, data analysis
Data Analyst - Processes CSVs, creates visualizations, statistics
Document Reader - Extracts from PDFs, Word docs, presentations
API Agent - Calls external APIs (weather, finance, databases)

Specialized Research:

Academic Agent - Searches arXiv, Google Scholar, PubMed
News Agent - Focused on recent news, trends, events
Social Listening - Twitter/Reddit sentiment, discussions
Comparison Agent - Side-by-side analysis of options

Quality Control:

Fact Checker - Cross-references claims against trusted sources
Bias Detector - Identifies political/commercial bias
Citation Formatter - Proper academic citations

Output Enhancement:

Visualizer - Creates charts, diagrams from data
Summary Agent - Different formats (ELI5, technical, executive)
Translation Agent - Multi-language research

Memory/Context:

Memory Agent - Stores past research, learns user preferences
Context Manager - Maintains conversation history across sessions
